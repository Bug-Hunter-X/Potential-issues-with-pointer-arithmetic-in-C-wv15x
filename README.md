# Potential Issues with Pointer Arithmetic in C

This repository demonstrates a simple C program that showcases a potential issue related to pointer arithmetic. The code modifies the value of an integer variable using a pointer, which is a common practice in C. However, there might be scenarios where this approach can lead to unexpected or unintended consequences if not handled carefully.

The purpose of this repository is to highlight these potential issues and to illustrate best practices for using pointers safely and effectively in C programming.
